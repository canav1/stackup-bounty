### Explanation

#### **Purpose:**
The purpose of the `safeTransferFrom` function within the `TransferHelper` library is to securely transfer a specified amount of an ERC-20 token from a source address to a destination address. This function abstracts the complexities involved in token transfers, ensuring they adhere to the ERC-20 standard and handling potential errors gracefully.

#### **Detailed Usage:**
The function leverages `abi.encodeWithSelector` to encode the `transferFrom` function selector along with the parameters (`from`, `to`, and `value`). This encoding ensures the correct function is called on the token contract.

1. **Function Encoding:**
    - The function uses `abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value)` to encode the `transferFrom` function call. This selector ensures that the `transferFrom` function of the ERC-20 token contract is correctly identified and called.
    - The `token.call(...)` is used to invoke the `transferFrom` function on the token contract.

2. **Execution and Verification:**
    - The call returns two values: `success` (a boolean indicating if the call was successful) and `data` (the returned data from the call).
    - The `require` statement checks if the call was successful and if the returned data is either empty or decodes to `true`.

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory data) =
    token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value));
require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'STF');
```

#### **Impact:**

The `safeTransferFrom` function is crucial for the `TransferHelper` library’s functionality within the Uniswap v3 protocol for several reasons:

1. **Token Transfer Abstraction:**
    - It abstracts the ERC-20 token transfer process, making it easier and safer to transfer tokens without directly interacting with the ERC-20 contract’s `transferFrom` method.
    - This function ensures compatibility with any ERC-20 token that adheres to the standard, providing flexibility in handling different tokens.

2. **Error Handling:**
    - The function includes error handling mechanisms to ensure that failed transfers are caught and handled appropriately, reverting with a specific error message (`'STF'`) if the transfer fails.

3. **Protocol Operations:**
    - In the context of Uniswap v3, which facilitates token swaps, the `safeTransferFrom` function enables the protocol to transfer tokens from a user’s wallet to the protocol’s contracts. This is essential for the swap functionality, where tokens need to be moved between different addresses to execute trades.
    - By using this helper function, Uniswap can ensure that the token transfers required for swaps and other operations are performed securely and reliably.

Overall, the `safeTransferFrom` function enhances the robustness and security of token transfers within the Uniswap v3 protocol, contributing significantly to the protocol’s seamless and efficient operation.
